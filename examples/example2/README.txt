Shows a simple ping server and client. The simpliest example there is.
Demonstraights how easy it is to setup a server.

This server simple waits for a ping message and
then sends a pong back. Any thing else is just
tossed out.

This source also includes a server (server.cpp)
to test this client.


BUILDING
Win32 - Use the dsp files
Linux - Run make. This will build both the client and server.
